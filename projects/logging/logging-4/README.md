# LoggerMessageAttribute

> .NET 6 introduces the LoggerMessageAttribute type. This attribute is part of the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging namespace, and when used, it source-generates performant logging APIs. The source-generation logging support is designed to deliver a highly usable and highly performant logging solution for modern .NET applications. The auto-generated source code relies on the ILogger interface in conjunction with LoggerMessage.Define functionality.
