# ASP.NET Core 9 (2)

These samples require SDK [9.0.100-preview.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)

* [TypedResults.InternalServerError](typed-results-2)

  This example shows how to return HTTP Status 500 using `TypedResults.InternalServerError`.

* [Built in OpenAPI generator](open-api-3)
